# Spanish Verb Quizzer

Quiz app for learning Spanish verb conjugations.

We start with an infinitive verb (to have, to be, to eat, etc) and conjugate it in six standard ways: first person singular (I have), first person plural (we have), second person singular (you have), second person plural (you [a group not including me] have), third person singular (he/she/it has) and third person plural (they [all male, all female, mixed group] have). These are generally displayed as a table with two columns (singular/plural) and three rows (first/second/third person).

Open index.html in your browser to try it out, clicking a question mark to reveal an answer and confirm your guess.
