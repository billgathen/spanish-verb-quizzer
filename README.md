# Spanish Verb Quizzer

Quiz app for learning Spanish verb conjugations.

We start with an infinitive verb (to have, to be, to eat, etc) and conjugate it in six standard ways:

- First person singular (I have)
- First person plural (we have)
- Second person singular (you have)
- Second person plural (you [a group not including me] have)
- Third person singular (he/she/it has)
- Third person plural (they [all male, all female, mixed group] have)
  
These are generally displayed as a table with two columns (singular/plural) and three rows (first/second/third person).
